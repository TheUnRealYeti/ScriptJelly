This is a small library of client-side vanilla JavaScript polyfills and general utility functions, inspired by jQuery and similar JavaScript frameworks. It is mostly written using ES3 and ES4 syntax to achieve maximum compatability with both legacy and modern Internet browsers. However, JavaScript functions and standards from ES5 and up are incorporated and prioritized over legacy methods when possible. 

When I was working with jQuery, I noticed there were only a few functions from the library that I was actually using. I started writing cross-compatible code that performed the exact same functions as the jQuery library functions, eventually eliminating any jQuery dependencies from my projects altogether. With time, I built a small collection of interconnected JavaScript files, classes, and methods that functioned stably across many devices, operating systems, and Internet browsers. 

I plan to contribute code to this library as I can. I aim to add minified file versions with comments stripped and generic variable and method names eventually. If you can find any bugs in the code or compatability issues with an Internet browser on a particular hardware platform or operating system, feel free to let me know, and I'll try to work to fix them as soon as possible.
